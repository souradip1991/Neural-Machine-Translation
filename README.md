Investigating the Correlation between Quality and Lexical Diversity in Training of Machine Translation Engines
Machine Translation (MT) is the automated process of converting a source language into a target language. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a relatively new MT paradigm that has shown great potential in solving complex and challenging translation tasks. Despite its superior translation performance (in terms of accuracy and ﬂuency) to other MT paradigms, there is still a long way to go for NMT to reach human performance. Due to the differences between machine translated text and human generated (either translated or authored) text, the former is referred in literature as Machine Translationese. The prime objective of our work is to study two aspects of machine translationese – its quality compared to humangenerated text and its lexical richness. We will investigate how different sentences in English ↔ Bengali, English ↔ French and English ↔ Spanish are translated by NMT models in different stages of its training and thereby compare lexical diversity and automatic evaluation scores. The ultimate goal is to identify a correlation between lexical diversity and evaluation metrics during the training process, trying to answer the question whether the best model in terms of evaluation metrics is the best in terms of lexical richness and vice versa.
